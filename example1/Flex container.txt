flex container
To initialise flexbox you have to have declare display: flex; on an element parent, you are then free to 
use flexbox on child elements inside as in the example below.

Here we use the markup below in the first example, it's applied on the parent div to flex the child divs 
with even space between them. We will go into more detail about these declarations later!
