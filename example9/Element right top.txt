element right top
If you want to align a child element in a specific position inside a 
parent element you have to use one or two flex declarations to achieve 
this. To place an element horizontally (left center right) inside the 
parent we use justify-content: flex-start/center/flex-end; To make 
this change vertically we use align-items: flex-start/center/flex-end; 
You can combine these as well, as you can see in the example listed.
